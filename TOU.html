	<h3>Terms Of Use</h3>
<p>
Big companies usually hire experienced lawyers to create a privacy policy for their websites and apps. Hiring a professional law firm to<br>create a privacy policy will likely cost a sizable amount of money and could take a lot of time.<br> 
<br>
The good news is that the majority of privacy policies on the internet today are made from templates that have universal wording. You might<br> be thinking about looking for those templates on the internet and going through them yourself, but please do not waste your time! <br>
<br>
Our team at PolicyMaker has already done it for you! We constantly check for the updates on the privacy policy laws worldwide and update<br> the PolicyMaker with the latest developments.<br> 
<br>
We create a VERY simple and universal privacy policy generator that will save you the time and stress of trying to write the privacy policy<br> yourself by using the templates!<br></p>
